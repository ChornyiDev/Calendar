# 📚 Libraries & Dependencies

The project is designed to be extremely lightweight with minimal external dependencies.

## 1. Development Dependencies
- **Vite:** Used for development serving and optimized production builds.

## 2. Runtime (Built-in)
The application relies strictly on browser-native APIs:
- **Intl API**: For robust timezone and date handling without external libraries like Moment.js or date-fns.
- **Native CSS Variables**: For the dynamic design system.
- **Fetch/ES Modules**: For modular code structure.
